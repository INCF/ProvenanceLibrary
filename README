Prototype implementation of the W3C Provenance Data Model
=========================================================

The src directory contains a C prototype library for implementing the W3C
provenance schema. Please note that the schema is a work in progress. We will
continue to monitor and improve the implementation.

We have derived a neuroprov library based on the prototype C library to enable
easier construction of W3C-Prov compatible provenance for neuroimaging
applications. Concurrent with this implementation we are developing a set of
terms for use in neuroimaging applications. The current list is at:

https://github.com/INCF/ProvenanceLibrary/wiki/terms

Please feel free to contribute new terms and definitions. We want this to evolve
into a process ontology that will then be hosted under a broader ontology.

A demo program in C is available.
